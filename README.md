## Description

This is a challenge that has me working with third party API's. For this challenge we were provided with the website built and a few things for us to finish. Some of the things that I fixed are:
- When someone opens the planner the current day is displayed at the top of the calender 
- When someone scrolls down they are presented twith a timeblock for some business hours 
- When someone views the timeblocks they are color cordinated for past, present, and future times
- When someone clicks on a timeblock they can type in somenotes and they are saved  in local storagewhen the page is reloaded
- When the password is generated it is displayed on the page
## Installation

Open the link in my GitHub Repo!

## Usage
- The date and time color coding is updated on its own

- You can click on the timeblocks to write notes for each block 

- Clicking on the save button for each timeblock will save the notes even when the page is reloaded

- Thats it!
